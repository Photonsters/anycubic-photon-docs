#### [**Chitu Slicer**](http://www.cbd-3d.com/en/soft/dlpslicer.shtml) (ANYCUBIC is rebranded Chitu)
Chitu devs have been helping Photonster devs with some support questions, and Chitu's new software release will allow for better integration of Photonsters tools with the slicer software, and will support many new formats including zip/gcode import/export.

#### [**Chitubox**](https://www.chitubox.com/) (New Slicer for the photon from the same makers of ChituDLP)
New software that integrates code and ideas first seen in the community projects VoxelOps, Validator, Rob's 3D photon Viewer and Photon File Editor Project

#### [**Photon Open Slicer**](https://github.com/Photonsters/Slicer) (Community developed OpenSource Slicer)
A independent command line Slicer from Photonsters, that can be integrated with MeshMixer or any other software capable of outputting a STL file. 


## Firmware & Configs

- [**Photon Firmware & Gcode Mods**](https://github.com/Photonsters/anycubic-photon-docs/tree/master/firmware)

## Community resin exposure settings
- [Known good resin settings - Curated by Artur Fuste](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1crvzMnt_8NJXAsABinoIhcOjE8l3h7s0L82Zlh1vkL8/edit#gid=0)
- Also checkout the resin exposure finder test under community projects.

## Community resin precision gauge test
[Resin Precision-Fit Test-Gauge](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yDwszgncTyOxvyJho6y1kxLJquH2GsfL83KaFXT6068)

This is for resin-tested with no software profile/compensation. Dimensions can be corrected by activating the horizontal-size compensation feature in your slicing software. If you don't have this feature, please contact your slicer developer.

## Printed Material Torsion Test Results
[Torsion Test Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JlqLSi4sxZLdA-hHCp6Ow4isoGMNI7nlE9Nmbj1ajWk)
