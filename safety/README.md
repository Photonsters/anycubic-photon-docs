# How to use your Photon, Resins and Cleaning solutions safely?


## Disclaimer
This info below is based upon information from the internet. You should do your own research and make your own assessment of what is safe enough for you. Furthermore you could be oversensitive and thus should take extra precautions. Lastly safety regulations may differ per country and differ from time to time. Take this also into account.


## Which Resin to Use 
Each resin is different and has a different composition. This also means that one resin can be harmless while the other may be toxic. You should download and read the Safety Data Sheet of your resin and cleaning solution to determine which precautions to take. The following text will use Data Sheet snippets from MonoCure Rapid Clear Resin as an example how to read a datasheet.


## How large is the Danger
The amount of danger you experience when using resins is determined by
- Type of Exposure
- Duration of Exposure
- Amount of Exposure
- Protection you have against Exposure


## Type of Exposure
The following types of exposure are important:
- Ingestion
- Skin contact
- Inhalation

To inderstand the risk of inhalation, see the wiki entry about vapour point https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure
The MonoCure 3D Clear Rapiud Safety Data Sheet tells us that the speed with which vapours escape is 0.25-0.5m/s when evaporating and 0.5-1.0m/s when pouring and moving an open container. They also explain that "Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point."

If we read the MonoCure 3D Clear Rapid Safety Data Sheet:
- _Ingestion_: "Immediately give a glass of water. First Aid is not generally required."
- _Skin contact_: "Flush skin and hair with running water (and soap if available). Seek medical attention in event of irritation."
- _Inhalation_: "Avoid breathing vapours..." "Store in tightly closed containers in a properly vented storage area..." " General exhaust is adequate...Local exhaust ventilation may be required in special cirumstances... If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator" "Evidence shows, or practical experience predits, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial nuumber of individuals, following inhalation...No report of respiratory illness in humans as a result of exposure to multiifunctional acrylates has ben found. Similarly evidence of systemic damage does not appear to exist."  


## Amount of Exposure
All datasheets will tell you the risks of two main different exposure types
- Normal Exposure, when cleaning, pouring and occasionable drips
- High Exposure, if you have major spills like your bottle falls and breaks on the ground 
The text in this document assumes Normal Exposure.


## Duration of Exposure
Also import for the danger of resins and solvents is the duration of exposure.
The MonoCure 3D Clear Rapid Safety Data Sheet:
- Skin contact: "Practical experience shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive response in experimental animals.
Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems."
- Inhalation: "Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems. Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.
Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.
Sensitisation may give severe responses to very low levels of exposure, in situations where exposure may occur."


## Protection against Exposure
- Ventilation
- Enclosure
- Mask

#### Ventilation
This serves to remove the harmfull vapours from your working area or at least dilute them enough to be harmless in their concentration.
- Work outside
- Open a window
- Actively remove air with a e.g. bathroom fan 

#### Enclosures
This serves to prevent harmfull vapours from entering your your working area. The enclosure should have ventilation to the outside so that when opening the enclosure (for removing/cleaning prints and pouring resins) you are not confronted with the vapours.

#### Masks
A mask you can be used to protect yourself from vapours, however not the people around you. However since you are closest to the source and thus experience the highest concentration, you are best of wearing one.
